All work is done via screen sharing, both of us worked on all parts of the project in equal measure

The initial dataset was found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ardamavi/sign-language- digits-dataset) (this dataset is of 64x64 greyscale images). The one we used can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset) (this has the 100x100x3 RGB images that we used throughout the project). To use it, just clone into the repository, copy and paste the “Dataset” folder in the same directory as the other .py files.
